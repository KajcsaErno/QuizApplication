# Quiz App
An Android Quiz App project to conclude the __Android Basics: User Input__ from *UDACITY Android Basics by Google.*
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice.  
We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this.  
It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user.

## What I learned? ##
This project is about combining various ideas and skills I’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Planning my app design before coding.
* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
* Creating, positioning, and styling views.
* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
* Commenting and documenting your code.

## Final result of my project - How logical are you?
